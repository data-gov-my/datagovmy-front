## Turborepo

This monorepo project is efficiently managed and organized using TurboRepo, a powerful tool that streamlines the development workflow for large-scale projects. TurboRepo simplifies the management of multiple projects and packages within a single repository, ensuring smooth collaboration, dependency management, and deployment processes.

#### Using TurboRepo

Installation: Ensure you have TurboRepo installed locally. You can install it globally or use it as a project dependency.

```bash
npm install -g @turbo/turbo
```

Configuration: This project has been configured with turborepo to manage workspaces, project dependencies. Find the configuration at root path in [turbo.json](/turbo.json)

Development Workflow: With TurboRepo in place, you can easily run commands like `turbo dev`, `turbo build`, and `turbo test` to manage your projects within the monorepo efficiently.

Publishing: TurboRepo offers a streamlined publishing process, making it straightforward to release new versions of your projects.

Learn more about turborepo by visiting its official docs [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:data-gov-my/datagovmy-front.git

# Yarn
yarn install
yarn prepare

# NPM
npm install
npx prepare

cp .env.example .env
```

## Commands to Know

```bash
# Start development server
yarn dev
# Start development server for specific workspace
yarn dev --filter=app

# Build production app
yarn build
# Build production app for specific workspace
yarn build --filter=app

# Start production server
yarn start

```

## Development Workflow

1. Branch out from `staging` & give the new branch a descriptive name eg: `feat/covid`, `fix/dropdown-bug` etc.
2. After you're done developing, `git fetch && git merge origin/staging` to synchronize any new changes & resolve conflicts, if there is any.
3. Push the branch to remote and create a PR to `staging`. Briefly describe the changes introduced in the PR.
4. Assign a core developer to review and wait for it to be approved.
5. That's all. Happy developing!
