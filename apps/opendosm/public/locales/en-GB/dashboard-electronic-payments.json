    "description": "Every electronic payment transaction is conducted using an instrument (credit card, debit card, e-money, etc), via a channel (mobile phone, internet, ATM, etc), and is processed through a system (FPX, interbank giro, JomPAY, RPP, etc). These transactions are recorded in real time. This means that as our world becomes more digitalised, policymakers have an increasingly powerful ability to monitor the economy in very high frequency. Using data from Bank Negara Malaysia's monthly payment statistics report, this dashboard shows you the latest trends in electronic payments. In the near future, it will be enriched with daily-frequency transactions data to assist with economic nowcasting.",
