As a result, SOCSO observes the Malaysian labour market in real time. For policymakers, SOCSO data is a critical complement to DOSM's Labour Force Survey, takes time to conduct to a high standard given that it is a representative nationwide survey. This dashboard brings you SOCSO's high-frequency labour data, and allows you to observe various labour market trends as they unfold!",
