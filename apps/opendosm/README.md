![opendosm-github.png](./public/static/images/opendosm-github.png?raw=true)

[OpenDOSM](https://open.dosm.gov.my), code-named _(AKSARA)_, is a web platform that catalogs, visualises, and analyses Malaysia's wealth of data provided by Department of Statistics Malaysia. Everything on this site is open-sourced and made available for the nation's benefit. If data is the new oil, then, openness is the pipeline that maximises its value.
