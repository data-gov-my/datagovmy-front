## What does Data Catalogue API do?

The Data Catalogue API is designed to allow users to access data from the data catalogue programmatically. It provides a set of endpoints that can be used to query the data based on various parameters and filters. The API is meant for use by developers and data scientists who want to programmatically access the data catalogue, although users who want to download data directly can also refer to the Data Catalogue page.

### How do I know what resources are available?

To determine the available resources and their corresponding IDs and fields, you can refer to the [Data Catalogue page](#TODO). The Data Catalogue page provides a comprehensive list of all the resources available in the catalogue, along with their associated IDs and fields.

By visiting the Data Catalogue page, you can browse through the available resources and explore their details. Each resource will have a unique ID that you can use when making requests to the Data Catalogue API. Additionally, you can view the fields or columns associated with each resource, which will help you understand the structure of the data and what information is available.

Make sure to regularly check the Data Catalogue page for any updates or new additions to the catalogue, as it will provide the most up-to-date information about the available resources and their corresponding IDs and fields.
