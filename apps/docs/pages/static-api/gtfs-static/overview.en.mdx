## What does GTFS Static do?

The GTFS Static API provides access to standardized public transportation schedules and geographic information, following the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS).
To learn more about GTFS and its specifications, you can visit the [GTFS documentation](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) provided by Google.

### Transport agencies involved

The GTFS-Static API incorporates data from various transport agencies. Agencies who contribute their transit data to the GTFS-Static API include:

- **KTMB (Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad)**: The main railway operator in Malaysia, providing train services across the country.
- **Prasarana**: A public transport operator responsible for managing various modes of transportation, including LRT (Light Rail Transit), MRT (Mass Rapid Transit), monorail, and bus services.
- **myBAS Johor Bahru**: A bus service operator in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, providing bus transportation on 19 routes across 5 corridors, including Kota Tinggi, Masai, Kulai, Gelang Patah, and Pontian.

### TODO: Update frequency

_TODO: be less vague and give actual frequency!_ (maybe should have a changelog?)

- updated x time a year etc.
- we recommend checking y times per day
- how to check when last modified? refer to api response x section..

The update frequency of the GTFS-Static data depends on the respective transport agencies. Each agency determines the frequency at which they publish updates to their transit data. The GTFS-Static API aims to provide the most up-to-date information available from the participating agencies. Developers utilizing the API should refer to the individual agency's update schedule or notifications for specific details on the frequency of data updates.
