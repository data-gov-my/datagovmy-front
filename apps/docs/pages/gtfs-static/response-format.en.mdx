## Response Format

### Valid Response

When making a successful request to the GTFS Static API, you will receive a response with a status code of `200`. The response format depends on the specific API request query and can include the following formats:

1. **GTFS ZIP Format**: If you request the complete GTFS static data without specifying a particular GTFS type, the API will return the full GTFS dataset in ZIP format. This ZIP file contains a collection of text files representing different aspects of transit information.

2. **Individual .txt Files**: When querying a specific GTFS type, such as `/gtfs/<gtfs_type>?download=true`, the API will return the corresponding text file in the GTFS dataset. Each GTFS type has its own file, containing relevant information for that specific aspect of public transportation data.

3. **JSON Format**: By default, or when specifying certain query parameters, the API can also return the GTFS data in JSON format. This provides a structured representation of the data, making it easier to parse and work with programmatically.

Please refer to [Request Query](/static-api/transport/gtfs-static/request-query) section for more details on how to construct the API request for the desired return format.

### Error Response

In case of an error, the GTFS Static API will return an error response in JSON format. The error response will contain the following elements:

```json
{
    status: <int>,
    errors: [...],
}
```

- `status` - This field indicates the response code corresponding to the error.
- `errors` - This field provides an array of error messages or descriptions.

The error response is designed to help you identify and troubleshoot the issue you encountered with your API requests.
