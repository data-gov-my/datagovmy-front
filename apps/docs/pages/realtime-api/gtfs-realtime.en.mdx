We have launched [GTFS Static](gtfs-static), and are currently in the process of gathering community feedback.
Our GTFS Realtime API has also been made live, but only to selected parties for a week of beta testing;
we target to release it to the public on November 14, 2023. Please stay tuned for updates!
