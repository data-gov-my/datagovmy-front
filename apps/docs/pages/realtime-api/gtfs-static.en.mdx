## GTFS Static API Endpoint

```http
GET https://api.data.gov.my/gtfs
```

## What does GTFS Static do?

GTFS Static API provides access to standardized public transportation schedules and geographic information, following the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS).
To learn more about GTFS and its specifications, you can visit the [GTFS documentation](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) provided by Google.

### Transport agencies involved

GTFS-Static API incorporates data from various transport agencies. Agencies who contribute their transit data to the GTFS-Static API include:

- **KTMB (Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad)**: The main railway operator in Malaysia, providing train services across the country.
- **Prasarana**: A public transport operator responsible for managing various modes of transportation, including LRT (Light Rail Transit), MRT (Mass Rapid Transit), monorail, and bus services.
- **myBAS Johor Bahru**: A bus service operator in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, providing bus transportation on 19 routes across 5 corridors, including Kota Tinggi, Masai, Kulai, Gelang Patah, and Pontian.

## TODO: Update frequency

_TODO: be less vague and give actual frequency! (changes should also be reflected in changelog)_

The GTFS transport data is typically updated multiple times a year to ensure accuracy and reflect any changes in the transportation network. The exact update frequency may vary depending on the transportation agency and their data management practices.

## GTFS Static Dataset Endpoints

The GTFS Static API provides access to public transportation data represented as a GTFS Feed, which consists of a collection of text files packaged in a ZIP file. Each file represents a specific aspect of transit information and can be individually queried using the `/gtfs/<gtfs_type>` endpoint, where `<gtfs_type>` corresponds to the specific file.

### Downloading the ZIP file

```http
GET .../gtfs
```

- If no GTFS data type is specified, the above request will return the complete GTFS dataset in ZIP format.

### Available GTFS Static Types

```http
# Syntax
GET .../gtfs/<gtfs_type>

# Example
GET .../gtfs/agency
```

The API supports the following GTFS data types:

| GTFS Type   | Description                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| agency      | Information about transit agencies               |
| calendar    | Service availability for specific dates          |
| frequencies | Frequency-based scheduling for trips             |
| routes      | Details about transit routes                     |
| stop_times  | Timetables and stop details for trips            |
| stops       | Information about transit stops                  |
| trips       | Specific trips with associated route information |

## Query Parameters

The following parameters are only applicable to the `/gtfs/<gtfs_type>` endpoint, please remember to specify the `<gtfs_type>` in your request.

### The `download` Parameter

```http
# Syntax
?download=<bool>

# Example (.txt format)
GET .../gtfs/agency?download=true

# Example (JSON format)
GET .../gtfs/agency?download=false
GET .../gtfs/agency
```

To control the format of the returned data, you can include the `download` parameter in your query. By default, or when `download` is set to false, GTFS data will be returned in JSON format. Setting `download` to true, however returns GTFS data in its original .txt format.

### The `area` Parameter

```http
# Syntax
?area=<state>

# Example
GET .../gtfs/agency?area=jhr
```

To filter the GTFS data based on a specific state, you can include the `area` parameter in your query. A few notes:

- Use the three-letter abbreviation for the state (eg. `jhr` for Johor and `kul` for WP Kuala Lumpur).
- Currently, only the state of Johor (`jhr`) is supported.

### Filtering by Fields

```http
# Example
?<field>=<value>

# Example
GET .../gtfs/agency?agency_name=CWL
```

Refer to the table below for the available fields for each GTFS type:

| GTFS Type   | Available Fields                                                                                                                           |

## Response Format

### Valid Response

When making a successful request to the GTFS Static API, you will receive a response with a status code of `200`. The response format depends on the specific API request query and can include the following formats:

1. **GTFS ZIP Format**: If you request the complete GTFS static data without specifying a particular GTFS type, the API will return the full GTFS dataset in ZIP format. This ZIP file contains a collection of text files representing different aspects of transit information.

2. **Individual .txt Files**: When querying a specific GTFS type, such as `/gtfs/<gtfs_type>?download=true`, the API will return the corresponding text file in the GTFS dataset. Each GTFS type has its own file, containing relevant information for that specific aspect of public transportation data.

3. **JSON Format**: By default, or when specifying certain query parameters, the API can also return the GTFS data in JSON format. This provides a structured representation of the data, making it easier to parse and work with programmatically.

Please refer to [Request Query](/static-api/transport/gtfs-static/request-query) section for more details on how to construct the API request for the desired return format.

### Error Response

In case of an error, the GTFS Static API will return an error response in JSON format. The error response will contain the following elements:

```json
{
    status: <int>,
    errors: [...],
}
```

- `status` - This field indicates the response code corresponding to the error.
- `errors` - This field provides an array of error messages or descriptions.

The error response is designed to help you identify and troubleshoot the issue you encountered with your API requests.
