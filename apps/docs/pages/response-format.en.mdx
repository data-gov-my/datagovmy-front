## Response Code

After sending an API request, you will receive a response with the following codes and headers, which indicate the status of your request:

| Code |      Status       | Description                                                                                                                          |

### Valid Response

When your request is successful, you will receive a `200 OK` response. By default, the API returns a list of records.
If you need more details, you can use the `meta` parameter:

```http
?meta=true
```

With `meta=true`, the response will look like this:

```json
{
    "meta": {...},
    "data": [...]
}
```

- `meta`: Provides basic information about the requested resource, including any applied filters.
- `data`: Contains the collection of records you requested.

### Error Response

If there is an error, the API will return an error response in JSON format. The error response includes the following elements:

```json
{
    status: <int>,
    errors: [...],
}
```

- `status`: Indicates the response code corresponding to the error.
- `errors`: Contains error messages or descriptions to help identify issues with the API request.

_\*Please note that for specific APIs in the future, there may be unique formats different from the general formats above, which will be clearly explained in the respective API documentation._
